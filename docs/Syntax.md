Layout
======

Groups of declarations are organized based on indentation.
Declarations with the same indentation belong to the same group.
Lines of text that are indented more than the beginning of a
declaration belong to that declaration, while lines of text that are
indented less terminate a group of declarations.  Groups of
declarations appear at the top level of a Cryptol file, and inside
`where` blocks in expressions.  For example, consider the following
declaration group

    f x = x + y + z
      where
      y = x * x
      z = x + y

    g y = y

This group has two declaration, one for `f` and one for `g`.  All the
lines between `f` and `g` that are indented more then `f` belong to
`f`.

This example also illustrates how groups of declarations may be nested
within each other.  For example, the `where` expression in the
definition of `f` starts another group of declarations, containing `y`
and `z`.  This group ends just before `g`, because `g` is indented
less than `y` and `z`.

Comments
========

Cryptol supports block comments, which start with `/*` and end with
`*/`, and line comments, which start with `//` and terminate at the
end of the line.  Block comments may be nested arbitrarily.

Examples:

    /* This is a block comment */
    // This is a line comment
    /* This is a /* Nested */ block comment */

Identifiers
===========

Cryptol identifiers consist of one or more characters.  The first
character must be either an English letter or underscore (`_`).  The
following characters may be an English letter, a decimal digit,
underscore (`_`), or a prime (`'`).  Some identifiers have special
meaning in the language, so they may not be used in programmer-defined
names (see [Keywords](#keywords-and-built-in-operators)).

Examples:

    name    name1    name'    longer_name
    Name    Name2    Name''   longerName

Numeric Literals
================

Numeric literals may be written in binary, octal, decimal, or
hexadecimal notation. The base of a literal is determined by its
prefix: `0b` for binary, `0o` for octal, no special prefix for
decimal, and `0x` for hexadecimal.

Examples:

    254                 // Decimal literal
    0254                // Decimal literal
    0b11111110          // Binary literal
    0o376               // Octal literal
    0xFE                // Hexadecimal literal
    0xfe                // Hexadecimal literal

Numeric literals represent finite bit sequences (i.e., they have type
`[n]`).  Using binary, octal, and hexadecimal notation results in bit
sequences of a fixed length, depending on the number of digits in the
literal.  Decimal literals are overloaded, and so the length of the
sequence is inferred from context in which the literal is used.
Examples:

    0b1010              // : [4],   1 * number of digits
    0o1234              // : [12],  3 * number of digits
    0x1234              // : [16],  4 * number of digits

    10                  // : {n}. (fin n, n >= 4) => [n]
                        //   (need at least 4 bits)

    0                   // : {n}. (fin n) => [n]

Bits
====

The type `Bit` has two inhabitants: `True` and `False`.  These values
may be combined using various logical operators, or constructed as
results of comparisons.

Operator              Associativity       Description

  `||`                left                Logical or
  `^`                 left                Exclusive-or
  `&&`                left                Logical and
  `!=` `==`           none                Not equals, equals

If Then Else with Multiway
==========================

`If then else` has been extended to support multi-way
conditionals. Examples:

    x = if y % 2 == 0 then 22 else 33

    x = if y % 2 == 0 then 1
         | y % 3 == 0 then 2
         | y % 5 == 0 then 3
         else 7

Tuples and Records
==================

Tuples and records are used for packaging multiples values together.
Tuples are enclosed in parenthesis, while records are enclosed in
braces.  The components of both tuples and records are separated by
commas.  The components of tuples are expressions, while the
components of records are a label and a value separated by an equal
sign.  Examples:

    (1,2,3)           // A tuple with 3 component
    ()                // A tuple with no components

    { x = 1, y = 2 }  // A record with two fields, `x` and `y`
    {}                // A record with no fields

The components of tuples are identified by position, while the
components of records are identified by their label, and so the
ordering of record components is not important.  Examples:

               (1,2) == (1,2)               // True
               (1,2) == (2,1)               // False

    { x = 1, y = 2 } == { x = 1, y = 2 }    // True
    { x = 1, y = 2 } == { y = 2, x = 1 }    // True

The components of a record or a tuple may be accessed in two ways: via
pattern matching or by using explicit component selectors.  Explicit
component selectors are written as follows:

    (15, 20).0           == 15
    (15, 20).1           == 20

    { x = 15, y = 20 }.x == 15

Explicit record selectors may be used only if the program contains
sufficient type information to determine the shape of the tuple or
record.  For example:

    type T = { sign : Bit, number : [15] }

    // Valid definition:
    // the type of the record is known.
    isPositive : T -> Bit
    isPositive x = x.sign

    // Invalid definition:
    // insufficient type information.
    badDef x = x.f

The components of a tuple or a record may also be accessed using
pattern matching.  Patterns for tuples and records mirror the syntax
for constructing values: tuple patterns use parenthesis, while record
patterns use braces.  Examples:

    getFst (x,_) = x

    distance2 { x = xPos, y = yPos } = xPos ^^ 2 + yPos ^^ 2

    f p = x + y where
        (x, y) = p

Sequences
=========

A sequence is a fixed-length collection of elements of the same type.
The type of a finite sequence of length `n`, with elements of type `a`
is `[n] a`.  Often, a finite sequence of bits, `[n] Bit`, is called a
_word_.  We may abbreviate the type `[n] Bit` as `[n]`.  An infinite
sequence with elements of type `a` has type `[inf] a`, and `[inf]` is
an infinite stream of bits.

    [e1,e2,e3]                        // A sequence with three elements

    [t .. ]                           // Sequence enumerations
    [t1, t2 .. ]                      // Step by t2 - t1
    [t1 .. t3 ]
    [t1, t2 .. t3 ]
    [e1 ... ]                         // Infinite sequence starting at e1
    [e1, e2 ... ]                     // Infinite sequence stepping by e2-e1

    [ e | p11 <- e11, p12 <- e12      // Sequence comprehensions
        | p21 <- e21, p22 <- e22 ]

Note: the bounds in finite unbounded (those with ..) sequences are
type expressions, while the bounds in bounded-finite and infinite
sequences are value expressions.

Operator                       Description
---------------------------    -----------
  `#`                          Sequence concatenation
  `>>`  `<<`                   Shift (right,left)
  `>>>` `<<<`                  Rotate (right,left)
  `@` `!`                      Access elements (front,back)
  `@@` `!!`                    Access sub-sequence (front,back)
  `update` `updateEnd`         Update the value of a sequence at a location (front,back)
  `updates` `updatesEnd`       Update multiple values of a sequence (front,back)

Table: Sequence operations.

There are also lifted point-wise operations.

    [p1, p2, p3, p4]          // Sequence pattern
    p1 # p2                   // Split sequence pattern

Functions
=========

    \p1 p2 -> e              // Lambda expression
    f p1 p2 = e              // Function definition

Local Declarations
==================

    e where ds

Note that by default, any local declarations without type signatures
are monomorphized. If you need a local declaration to be polymorphic,
use an explicit type signature.

Explicit Type Instantiation
===========================

If `f` is a polymorphic value with type:

    f : { tyParam }
    f = zero

you can evaluate `f`, passing it a type parameter:

    f `{ tyParam = 13 }


Demoting Numeric Types to Values
================================

The value corresponding to a numeric type may be accessed using the
following notation:

    `{t}

Here `t` should be a type expression with numeric kind.  The resulting
expression is a finite word, which is sufficiently large to accommodate
the value of the type:

    `{t} : {w >= width t}. [w]

Explicit Type Annotations
=========================

Explicit type annotations may be added on expressions, patterns, and
in argument definitions.

    e : t

    p : t

    f (x : t) = ...

Type Signatures
===============

    f,g : {a,b} (fin a) => [a] b

Type Synonym Declarations
=========================

    type T a b = [a] b
