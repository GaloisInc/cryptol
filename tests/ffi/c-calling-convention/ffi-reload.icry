// Double quotes must be used to make the command below work on Windows.

// Very confusingly, the ffi-reload.dll file that this script creates on
// Windows will not have the permissions you expect it to, which will cause
// 'Permission denied' errors when trying to overwrite it later in the script.
// The simplest workaround that I have found is to delete the file and then
// recompile it. (Yes, you have the permissions to delete it, but not to
// overwrite it. I have no idea why.)
