``cryptol-remote-api``
======================

This is the JSON-RPC server for Cryptol. It is primarily intended for
using an executable Cryptol specification as part of a prototype or a
system in which performance is less important. It supports loading and
type checking Cryptol modules along with some basic REPL-like interaction
(e.g., evaluating Cryptol expressions).

This server is based on the `argo <https://github.com/GaloisInc/argo>`_
library, and uses its conventions regarding application state, message
format, and transport layers.

Command-line options
--------------------

Please run ``cryptol-remote-api --help`` for a summary of command-line
options. There are three subcommands, one for each transport that the
server supports: ``stdio``, ``socket``, and ``http``. Please consult
the documentation for ``argo`` for more details on these.

Protocol and Documentation
--------------------------

The protocol description and documentation are available in the
``docs`` subdirectory. The documentation is in Sphinx format. Run
``make html`` to generate readable HTML.

Obtaining the Python bindings
-----------------------------

The Python bindings for ``cryptol-remote-api`` are presently part of
the ``argo`` repository. Please see its README for installation
instructions.

Testing the Python bindings
---------------------------

After installing the Python bindings, they can be tested. The test
script is in the ``test-scripts`` subdirectory.

To test out the Python bindings, load the test file in a Python
REPL. We recommend ``ipython3``, because it provides easy access to
docstrings and tab completion. Here's an example command line and
Python session to give you an idea of what's currently implemented,
with commentary in the form of Python comments::

    $ ipython3 -i cryptol-api_test.py
    Python 3.7.2 (default, Jan 16 2019, 19:49:22)

    # A CryptolConnection represents a connection to the Cryptol server
    # that has a particular state. The state is created by issuing commands
    # such as loading files. The test file creates a connection, changes the
    # working directory, and loads a file called Foo.cry.
    In [1]: c?
    Type:        CryptolConnection

    [['change directory', {'directory': '/home/dtc/Projects/proto/proto/python'}],
     ['load module', {'file': 'Foo.cry'}]]

    # A CryptolContext is a wrapper around a connection that allows easy access to
    # the names in scope at that particular state. Constructing a CryptolContext
    # takes a lightweight snapshot of the state, so it will still work even if the
    # connection is later used for other commands.
    In [3]: ctx = CryptolContext(c)


    # The Connection is a low-level interface, without easy access to Cryptol. It is
    # not particularly suitable to interactive experimentation, but may be a good target
    # for applications looking to script Cryptol.
    In [4]: c.add?
    Object `c.add` not found.

    # The Context has methods corresponding to each name in scope, though there is not
    # yet an easy way to call infix operators. Note that the Cryptol type is shown as
    # part of the Python docstring.
    In [5]: ctx.add?

    # There are heuristic rules for converting Python data to the associated Cryptol
    # data, taking the Cryptol type into account:
    In [6]: ctx.add(bytes.fromhex('ff'), bytes.fromhex('01'))
    Out[6]: b'\x00'

    # Additionally, the current state of a connection can be used to construct a Python
    # module from which Cryptol names can be imported directly:

    In [7]: cryptol.add_cryptol_module('Foo', c)

    In [8]: from Foo import *

    # Because b'\2' is enough to solve the type variable a in add's type, the integer 2
    # can be used as a bitvector. There is not yet a way to supply a explicitly.
    In [9]: add(b'\2', 2)
    Out[9]: b'\x04'

    # Cryptol documentation is also carried over to Python, whether through a Context or
    # through a module.
    In [10]: ctx.carry?

Emacs
~~~~~

There is a little test rig written in Emacs Lisp to automate the
production of commands and log responses. Emacs was chosen because it
makes it easy to run a subprocess and communicate with it over a pipe
or socket --- don't expect fancy editor support for Cryptol or much
ease of use from the integration. Note that these commands can be
sensitive to the current working directory in Emacs. The Emacs test
rig is also in the ``argo`` repository.

There are two ways to use it: over stdio, or over a socket. The
initial setup for both is the same:

1. Launch emacs

2. Open ``proto-test.el``

3. Evaluate the buffer: ``M-x eval-buffer`` or on Spacemacs: ``, e b``

To use the stdio version:

1. ``M-x proto-test-start``

2. At the prompt for ``Command:``, run the server with
   ``cabal v2-exec -v0 cryptol-remote-api -- stdio``.

If this leaves a confusing error message in Emacs, the output was
probably corrupted by ``cabal-install`` stating that nothing needs
building. Run ``cabal v2-build all`` to make sure that all builds are
up-to-date, and try again.


To use the socket version:

1. At a shell, run ``cabal v2-exec cryptol-remote-api -- socket --port 10006``
   (or pick your favorite port instead of 10006)

2. In Emacs, ``M-x proto-test-start-socket``. When prompted, enter
   ``10006`` or your choice of port.

Invoking methods:

Currently it is necessary to load a file first before using any other
methods, because that brings the Cryptol prelude into scope. These
Elisp wrappers will prompt you for appropriate input.

1. ``M-x proto-test-cryptol-load-file``
2. ``M-x proto-test-cryptol-eval``
3. ``M-x proto-test-cryptol-change-directory``
4. ``M-x proto-test-cryptol-call``
5. ``M-x proto-test-cryptol-focused-module``
6. ``M-x proto-test-cryptol-check-type``
7. ``M-x proto-test-cryptol-cyptol-satisfy``

Terminating the demo:

1. ``M-x proto-test-quit``
