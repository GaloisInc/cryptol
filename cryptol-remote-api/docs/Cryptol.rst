Cryptol RPC Server
==================

Fundamental Protocol
--------------------

This application is a `JSON-RPC <https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`_ server. Additionally, it maintains a persistent cache of application states and explicitly indicates the state in which each command is to be carried out.

Transport
~~~~~~~~~

The server supports three transport methods:


``stdio``
  in which the server communicates over ``stdin`` and ``stdout`` using `netstrings. <http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt>`_
  
  

``socket``
  in which the server communicates over a socket using `netstrings. <http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt>`_
  
  

``http``
  in which the server communicates over a socket using HTTP.
  
  

Application State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the JSON-RPC specification, the ``params`` field in a message object must be an array or object. In this protocol, it is always an object. While each message may specify its own arguments, every message has a parameter field named ``state``.

When the first message is sent from the client to the server, the ``state`` parameter should be initialized to the JSON null value ``null``. Replies from the server may contain a new state that should be used in subsequent requests, so that state changes executed by the request are visible.

In particular, per JSON-RPC, non-error replies are always a JSON object that contains a ``result`` field. The result field always contains an ``answer`` field and a ``state`` field, as well as ``stdout`` and ``stderr``.


``answer``
  The value returned as a response to the request (the precise contents depend on which request was sent).
  
  

``state``
  The state, to be sent in subsequent requests. If the server did not modify its state in response to the command, then this state may be the same as the one sent by the client. When a new state is in a server response, the previous state may no longer be available for requests.
  
  

``stdout`` and ``stderr``
  These fields contain the contents of the Unix ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` file descriptors. They are intended as a stopgap measure for clients who are still in the process of obtaining structured information from the libraries on which they depend, so that information is not completely lost to users. However, the server may or may not cache this information and resend it. Applications are encouraged to used structured data and send it deliberately as the answer.
  
  
The precise structure of states is considered an implementation detail that could change at any time. Please treat them as opaque tokens that may be saved and re-used within a given server process, but not created by the client directly.



Summary
-------

An RCP server for `Cryptol <https://https://cryptol.net/>`_ that supports type checking and evaluation of Cryptol code via the methods documented below.


Terms and Types
---------------

.. _Expression:
JSON Cryptol Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the API, Cryptol expressions can be represented by the following:


JSON Booleans
  Represent the corresponding Cryptol Booleans
  
  

JSON Integers
  Cryptol integer literals, that can be used at a variety of types
  
  

JSON Strings
  Cryptol concrete syntax
  
  

JSON Objects
  Objects can represent a variety of Cryptol expressions. The field ``expression`` contains a tag that can be used to determine the remaining fields.
  
  
The tag values in objects can be:


``bits``
  
  * The expression is a bitvector. Further fields are:
    
    
  
  * ``encoding``: Either the string ``base64`` or ``hex``, for base-64 or hexadecimal representations of the bitvector
    
    
  
  * ``data``: A string containing the actual data
    
    
  
  * ``width``: An integer: the bit-width of the represented bit vector
    
    
  

``record``
  The expression is a record. The field ``data`` is a JSON object that maps record field names to :ref:`JSON Cryptol expressions <Expression>`.
  
  

``sequence``
  The expression is a sequence. The field ``data``contains a JSON array of the elements of the sequence; each is a JSON Cryptol expression.
  
  

``tuple``
  The expression is a tuple. The field ``data``contains a JSON array of the elements of the tuple; each is a JSON Cryptol expression.
  
  

``unit``
  The expression is the unit constructor, and there are no further fields.
  
  

``let``
  
  * The expression is a ``where``binding. The fields are:
    
    
  
  * 
    ``binders``
      
      * A list of binders. Each binder is an object with two fields:
        
        
      
      * ``name``: A string that is the name to be bound, and
        
        
      
      * ``definition``A :ref:`JSON Cryptol expression <Expression>`.
        
        
      
    
    ``body``
      A :ref:`JSON Cryptol expression <Expression>` in which the bound names may be used.
      
      
    
  

``call``
  
  * The expression is a function application. Further fields are:
    
    
  
  * ``function``: A :ref:`JSON Cryptol expression <Expression>`.
    
    
  
  * ``arguments``: A JSON array of :ref:`JSON Cryptol expressions <Expression>`.
    
    
  

``instantiate``
  
  * The expression is a type application. Further fields are:
    
    
  
  * ``generic``: The polymorphic expression to be instantiated
    
    
  
  * ``arguments``: A JSON object in which keys are the names of type parameters and values are :ref:`JSON Cryptol types <JSONSchema>`.
    
    
  

``integer modulo``
  
  * The expression is an integer with a modulus (the Cryptol ``Z`` type). Further fields are:
    
    
  
  * ``integer``: A JSON number, representing the integer
    
    
  
  * ``modulus``: A JSON number, representing the modulus
    
    
  

``variable``
  The expression is a variable bound by the server. The field ``identifier`` contains the name of the variable.
  
  

.. _JSONSchema:
JSON Cryptol Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JSON representations of types are type schemas. A type schema has three fields:


``forall``
  Contains an array of objects. Each object has two fields: ``name`` is the name of a type variable, and ``kind`` is its kind. There are four kind formers: the string ``Type`` represents ordinary datatypes, the string ``Num`` is the kind of numbers, and ``Prop`` is the kind of propositions. Arrow kinds are represented by objects in which the field ``kind`` is the string ``arrow``, and the fields ``from`` and ``to`` are the kinds on the left and right side of the arrow, respectively.
  
  

``propositions``
  A JSON array of the constraints in the type.
  
  

``type``
  The type in which the variables from ``forall`` are in scope and the constraints in ``propositions`` are in effect.
