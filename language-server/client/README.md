This extension provides support for working with [Cryptol](https://cryptol.net).

The extension requires `cryptol-language-server`, which is included with
Cryptol's binary release distributions. Once the extension is installed,
modify its `language-server-path` setting to point to the language server
binary.

The extension supports:

  * Syntax highlighting
  * View documentation when hovering over an identify
  * Go to definition
  * Show type information for identifiers and numeric literals
