This extension provides language support for Cryptol specifications.

The extension relies on a language server which needs to be installed
separately.

Packaging and Installing the VSCode Client
------------------------------------------

The source code for teh client is in the `client` subdirectory.
You'll need `node` already installed.

Install dependencies:

    client> npm install

Build a VSCode package:

    client> npm run package

If everything went OK you should see a file called `cryptol-0.0.1.vsix`

To install the extension in VSCode, open the extensions tab, and from
the menu (three little dots) select "Install from VSIX".  Once the extension
is installed, open the settings, and find its settings to specify the
path to the language server binary.


Installing the Language Server
-------------------------------

To build the server run the `./build` script.  If successful, there
should be a bonary called `cryptol-language-server` in a `bin` subdirectory.
The location of the server in VSCode should point to this binary.
