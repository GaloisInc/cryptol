This extension provides language support for Cryptol specifications.

The extension relies on a language server, which needs to be installed
separately.

Packaging and Installing the VSCode Client
==========================================

The source code for the client is in the `client` subdirectory.
You'll need `node` already installed.

Install dependencies:

    client> npm install

Installing Locally
------------------

Build a VSCode package:

    client> npm run package

If everything went OK you should see a file called
`cryptol-language-server-`X.Y.Z`.vsix`.

To install the extension in VSCode, open the extensions tab, and from
the menu (three little dots) select "Install from VSIX".  Once the extension
is installed, open the settings, and find its settings to specify the
path to the language server binary.

Publishing to the VSCode Marketplace
------------------------------------

To publish the current version of the client to the VSCode marketplace,
you'll need a personal access token with Azuzre DevOps, which should be
added to the Galois publisher:

   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/GaloisInc

Once you have one of those, you can publish a new extension like this:

    client> npm run publish

You'll need to provide your personal access token when asked.


Installing the Language Server
==============================

The `cryptol-language-server` binary is included in the Cryptol
release distribution, and may also be built locally by running
the `./build` script, which deposits the binary into the `bin`
subdirectory.
