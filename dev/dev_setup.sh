# Supported distribution(s):
#  * macOS 14 (AArch64)

#  * Ubuntu 22.04 (x86_64)
#
# This script installs everything needed to get a working development
# environment for cryptol. Any new environment requirements should be
# added to this script. This script is not interactive but it may define
# some environment variables that need to be loaded after it runs.
# For a list of the setup operations performed by this script, see the
# "Main Operations" section near the end of this file.
# Assumptions:
# - In Ubuntu, we assume that the system has already run `apt-get update`
# - In macOS, we assume the system has `brew` installed and on the path
#
# There is some half-baked support for macOS 13 (x86_64),
# but it hasn't been tested.
