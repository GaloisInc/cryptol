1.  Introduction

   Since the initial standardization of elliptic curve cryptography
   (ECC) in [SEC1] there has been significant progress related to both
   efficiency and security of curves and implementations.  Notable
   examples are algorithms protected against certain side-channel
   attacks, various 'special' prime shapes which allow faster modular
   arithmetic, and a larger set of curve models from which to choose.
   There is also concern in the community regarding the generation and
   potential weaknesses of the curves defined in [NIST].

   This memo describes a deterministic algorithm for generating
   cryptographic elliptic curves over a given prime field.  The
   constraints in the generation process produce curves that support
   constant-time, exception-free scalar multiplications that are
   resistant to a wide range of side-channel attacks including timing
   and cache attacks, thereby offering high practical security in
   cryptographic applications.  The deterministic algorithm operates
   without any input parameters that would permit manipulation of the
   resulting curves.  The selection between curve models is determined

   by choosing the curve form that supports the fastest (currently
   known) complete formulas for each modularity option of the underlying
   field prime.  Specifically, the Edwards curve x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2
   is used with primes p with p = 3 mod 4, and the twisted Edwards curve
   -x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2 is used when p = 1 mod 4.

   This document is an executable specification. Blocks of code surrounded
   by three back-ticks (`) denote a section of Cryptol code which can be

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Security Requirements

   For each curve at a specific security level:

   1.  The domain parameters SHALL be generated in a simple,
       deterministic manner, without any secret or random inputs.  The
       derivation of the curve parameters is defined in Section 5.

   2.  The trace of Frobenius MUST NOT be in {0, 1} in order to rule out
       the attacks described in [Smart], [AS], and [S], as in [EBP].

   3.  MOV Degree: the embedding degree k MUST be greater than (r - 1) /
       100, as in [EBP].

   4.  CM Discriminant: discriminant D MUST be greater than 2^100, as in
       [SC].

4.  Notation

   Throughout this document, the following notation is used:

   p  Denotes the prime number defining the underlying field.

   GF(p)  The finite field with p elements.

   A  An element in the finite field GF(p), not equal to -1 or zero.

   d  An element in the finite field GF(p), not equal to -1 or zero.

   P  A generator point defined over GF(p) of prime order.

   X(P)  The x-coordinate of the elliptic curve point P on a (twisted)
      Edwards curve.

   Y(P)  The y-coordinate of the elliptic curve point P on a (twisted)
      Edwards curve.

5.  Parameter Generation

   This section describes the generation of the curve parameter, namely
   A, of the Montgomery curve y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x.  The input to this
   process is p, the prime that defines the underlying field.  The size
   of p determines the amount of work needed to compute a discrete
   logarithm in the elliptic curve group and choosing a precise p
   depends on many implementation concerns.  The performance of the
   curve will be dominated by operations in GF(p) and thus carefully
   choosing a value that allows for easy reductions on the intended
   architecture is critical.  This document does not attempt to
   articulate all these considerations.

   The value (A-2)/4 is used in several of the elliptic curve point
   arithmetic formulas.  For simplicity and performance reasons, it is
   beneficial to make this constant small, i.e. to choose A so that
   (A-2) is a small integer which is divisible by four.

5.1.  p = 1 mod 4

   For primes congruent to 1 mod 4, the minimal cofactors of the curve
   and its twist are either {4, 8} or {8, 4}. We choose a curve with the
   latter cofactors so that any algorithms that take the cofactor into
   account don't have to worry about checking for points on the twist,
   because the twist cofactor is larger.

   To generate the Montgomery curve we find the minimal, positive A
   value such (A-2) is divisible by four and where the cofactors are as
   desired.  The "find1Mod4" function in the following Sage script
   returns this value given p:

5.2.  p = 3 mod 4

   For a prime congruent to 3 mod 4, both the curve and twist cofactors
   can be 4 and this is minimal.  Thus we choose the curve with these
   cofactors and minimal, positive A such that (A-2) is divisible by
   four.  The "find3Mod4" function in the following Sage script returns
   this value given p:

>   def find3Mod4(prime):
>       assert((prime % 4) == 3)
>       return findCurve(prime, 4, 4)
>
>                   Generating a curve where p = 3 mod 4

5.3.  Base points

   The base point for a curve is the point with minimal, positive u
   value that is in the correct subgroup.  The "findBasepoint" function
   in the following Sage script returns this value given p and A:

6.  Recommended Curves

   For the ~128-bit security level, the prime 2^255-19 is recommended
   for performance on a wide-range of architectures.  This prime is
   congruent to 1 mod 4 and the above procedure results in the following
   Montgomery curve, called "curve25519":

   The base point is u = 9, v = 1478161944758954479102059356840998688726
   4606134616475288964881837755586237401.

>     (x, y) = (sqrt(-1)*sqrt(486664)*u/v, (u-1)/(u+1)

   The Montgomery curve defined here is equal to the one defined in
   [curve25519] and the isomorphic twisted Edwards curve is equal to the
   one defined in [ed25519].

```cryptol

6.2.  Goldilocks

   For the ~224-bit security level, the prime 2^448-2^224-1 is
   recommended for performance on a wide-range of architectures.  This
   prime is congruent to 3 mod 4 and the above procedure results in the
   following Montgomery curve, called "curve448":

   That curve is also 4-isogenous to the following Edward's curve x^2 +
   y^2 = 1 + d*x^2*y^2, called "Ed448-Goldilocks":

   The 4-isogeny maps between the Montgomery curve and the Edward's
   curve are:

  (u, v) = (x^2/y^2, (2 - x^2 - y^2)*x/y^3)
  (x, y) = (4*v*(u^2 - 1)/(u^4 - 2*u^2 + 4*v^2 + 1), (u^5 - 2*u^3 - 4*u*v^2 + u)/(u^5 - 2*u^2*v^2 - 2*u^3 - 2*v^2 + u))

```

7.  The curve25519 and curve448 functions

   The "curve25519" and "curve448" functions performs scalar
   multiplication on the Montgomery form of the above curves.  (This is
   used when implementing Diffie-Hellman.)  The functions take a scalar
   and a u-coordinate as inputs and produce a u-coordinate as output.
   Although the functions work internally with integers, the inputs and
   outputs are 32-byte strings and this specification defines their
   encoding.

   U-coordinates are elements of the underlying field GF(2^255-19) or
   GF(2^448-2^224-1) and are encoded as an array of bytes, u, in little-
   endian order such that u[0] + 256 * u[1] + 256^2 * u[2] + ... + 256^n
   * u[n] is congruent to the value modulo p and u[n] is minimal.  When
   receiving such an array, implementations of curve25519 (but not

   curve448) MUST mask the most-significant bit in the final byte.  This
   is done to preserve compatibility with point formats which reserve
   the sign bit for use in other protocols and to increase resistance to
   implementation fingerprinting.

   For example, the following functions implement this in Python,
   although the Python code is not intended to be performant nor side-
   channel free.  Here the "bits" parameter should be set to 255 for
   curve25519 and 448 for curve448:

 def decodeLittleEndian(b,bits):
     return sum([b[i] << 8*i for i in range((bits+7)/8)])

 def decodeUCoordinate(u,bits):
     u_list = [ord(b) for b in u]
     if bits % 8:
         u_list[-1] &= (1<<(bits%8))-1
     return decodeLittleEndian(u_list,bits)

 def encodeUCoordinate(u,bits):
     u = u % p
     return ''.join([chr((u >> 8*i) & 0xff) for i in range((bits+7)/8)])

   (EDITORS NOTE: draft-turner-thecurve25519function also says
   "Implementations MUST reject numbers in the range [2^255-19,
   2^255-1], inclusive." but I'm not aware of any implementations that
   do so.)

```
// Decode little endian bytes into Curve25519
decodeLittleEndian : {a} (fin a, a >= 1) => [a][8] -> [a*8]
decodeLittleEndian bytes = s ! 0
  where s = [zero] # [(acc<<8) + (zero#byte) | acc <- s | byte <- reverse bytes]

decodeUCoordinate25519 : [32][8] -> [256]
decodeUCoordinate25519 u = decodeLittleEndian ((u @@ ([0..30] : [_][5])) # [((u@31) && 127)])

decodeUCoordinate448 : [448/8][8] -> [448]
decodeUCoordinate448 u = decodeLittleEndian u

encodeUCoordinate : {a} (fin a) => [a*8] -> [a*8] -> [a][8]
encodeUCoordinate p u = reverse (split `{each=8} u')

   Scalars are assumed to be randomly generated bytes.  For curve25519,
   in order to decode 32 bytes into an integer scalar, set the three
   least significant bits of the first byte and the most significant bit
   of the last to zero, set the second most significant bit of the last
   byte to 1 and, finally, decode as little-endian.  This means that
   resulting integer is of the form 2^254 + 8 * {0, 1, ..., 2^(251) -
   1}.  Likewise, for curve448, set the two least significant bits of
   the first byte to 0, and the most significant bit of the last byte to
   1.  This means that the resulting integer is of the form 2^447 + 4 *
   {0, 1, ..., 2^(445) - 1}.

   (where "k" is the scalar and "u" is the u-coordinate) first decode

   [curve25519] and based on formulas from [montgomery].  All
   calculations are performed in GF(p), i.e., they are performed modulo
   p.  The constant a24 is (486662 - 2) / 4 = 121665 for curve25519, and

   Finally, encode the resulting value as 32 or 56 bytes in little-
   endian order.

```cryptol

Curve25519 priv pub = encodeUCoordinate pCurve25519 (curveX a24Curve25519 pCurve25519 (decodeScalar25519 priv) (decodeUCoordinate25519 pub))

Curve448 priv pub = encodeUCoordinate pCurve448 (curveX a24Curve448 pCurve448 (decodeScalar448 priv) (decodeUCoordinate448 pub))

// basePoints are not discussed, but a DH section exists - I suggest revision.
basePoint25519 = reverse (split 9)
basePoint448   = reverse (split 5)
```

   When implementing this procedure, due to the existence of side-
   channels in commodity hardware, it is important that the pattern of
   memory accesses and jumps not depend on the values of any of the bits
   of "k".  It is also important that the arithmetic used not leak
   information about the integers modulo p (such as having b*c be
   distinguishable from c*c).

   The cswap instruction SHOULD be implemented in constant time
   (independent of "swap") as follows:

   cswap(swap, x_2, x_3):
         dummy = swap * (x_2 - x_3)
         x_2 = x_2 - dummy
         x_3 = x_3 + dummy
         Return (x_2, x_3)

   where "swap" is 1 or 0.  Alternatively, an implementation MAY use the
   following:

   cswap(swap, x_2, x_3):
         dummy = mask(swap) AND (x_2 XOR x_3)
         x_2 = x_2 XOR dummy
         x_3 = x_3 XOR dummy
         Return (x_2, x_3)

```cryptol
cswap : {a} (fin a, a >= 1,10 >= width (a-1)) => Bit -> [a] -> [a] -> ([a] , [a])
cswap st x2 x3 = (x2 ^ dummy ,x3 ^ dummy)
  where dummy = [st | _ <- [0..a-1] : [_][10] ] && (x2 ^ x3)
```


   where "mask(swap)" is the all-1 or all-0 word of the same length as
   x_2 and x_3, computed, e.g., as mask(swap) = 1 - swap.  The latter
   version is often more efficient.

8.  Diffie-Hellman

   The "curve25519" function can be used in an ECDH protocol as follows:

   Alice generates 32 random bytes in f[0] to f[31] and transmits K_A =
   curve25519(f, 9) to Bob, where 9 is the u-coordinate of the base
   point and is encoded as a byte with value 9, followed by 31 zero
   bytes.

   Bob similarly generates 32 random bytes in g[0] to g[31] and computes
   K_B = curve25519(g, 9) and transmits it to Alice.

   Alice computes curve25519(f, K_B); Bob computes curve25519(g, K_A)
   using their generated values and the received input.

Internet-Draft                  cfrgcurve                     March 2015


   Both now share K = curve25519(f, curve25519(g, 9)) = curve25519(g,
   curve25519(f, 9)) as a shared secret.  Both MUST check, without
   leaking extra information about the value of K, whether K is the all-
   zero value and abort if so (see below).  Alice and Bob can then use a
   key-derivation function, such as hashing K, to compute a key.

   The check for the all-zero value results from the fact that the
   curve25519 function produces that value if it operates on an input
   corresponding to a point with order dividing the co-factor, h, of the
   curve.  This check is cheap and so MUST always be carried out.  The
   check may be performed by ORing all the bytes together and checking
   whether the result is zero as this eliminates standard side-channels
   in software implementations.

8.2 Utility Functions


In the textual specification arithmatic is modular.  For the Cryptol code
modular arithmatic must be explicitly implemented, which has been done in a
separate file.

```cryptol
mul, add, sub, power,div : {a} (fin a, a>=1) => [a] -> [a] -> [a] -> [a]
power p a b = mod_pow(p, a, b)
mul p a b = mod_mul(p, a, b)
add p a b = mod_add(p, a, b)
sub p a b = mod_sub(p, a, b)
div p x y   = mod_div(p,x,y)
square p a  = mul p a a
```
