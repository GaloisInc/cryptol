# The Poly1305 algorithm

Poly1305 is a one-time authenticator designed by D. J. Bernstein.
Poly1305 takes a 32-byte one-time key and a message and produces a
16-byte tag.

The original article ([poly1305]) is entitled "The Poly1305-AES
message-authentication code", and the MAC function there requires a
128-bit AES key, a 128-bit "additional key", and a 128-bit (non-
secret) nonce.  AES is used there for encrypting the nonce, so as to
get a unique (and secret) 128-bit string, but as the paper states,
"There is nothing special about AES here.  One can replace AES with
an arbitrary keyed function from an arbitrary set of nonces to 16-
byte strings."

Regardless of how the key is generated, the key is partitioned into
two parts, called "r" and "s".  The pair ``(r,s)`` should be unique, and
MUST be unpredictable for each invocation (that is why it was
originally obtained by encrypting a nonce), while "r" MAY be
constant, but needs to be modified as follows before being used: ("r"
is treated as a 16-octet little-endian number):

 *  r[3], r[7], r[11], and r[15] are required to have their top four
    bits clear (be smaller than 16)

```cryptol
Om = 15 // odd masks - for 3, 7, 11 & 15
```
 *  r[4], r[8], and r[12] are required to have their bottom two bits
    clear (be divisible by 4)

The following Cryptol code clamps "r" to be appropriate:

```cryptol
Em = 252 // even masks - for 4, 8 & 12
nm = 255 // no mask

PolyMasks : [16][8]            // mask indices
PolyMasks = [ nm, nm, nm, Om,  // 0-3
              Em, nm, nm, Om,  // 4-7
              Em, nm, nm, Om,  // 8-11
              Em, nm, nm, Om ] // 12-15

Poly1305_clamp : [16][8] -> [16][8]
Poly1305_clamp r = [ re && mask | re <- r | mask <- PolyMasks ]
```

The "s" should be unpredictable, but it is perfectly acceptable to
generate both "r" and "s" uniquely each time.  Because each of them
is 128-bit, pseudo-randomly generating them (see "Generating the
Poly1305 key using ChaCha20") is also acceptable.

The inputs to Poly1305 are:

 *  A 256-bit one-time key
 *  An arbitrary length message (comprised of `floorBlocks` 16-byte blocks,
    and `rem` bytes left over)

The output is a 128-bit tag.

```cryptol
Poly1305 : {m, floorBlocks, rem} (fin m, floorBlocks == m/16, rem == m - floorBlocks*16) 
           => [256] -> [m][8] -> [16][8]
```

Set the constant prime "P" be 2^130-5.

```cryptol
P : [136]
P = 2^^130 - 5
```

First, the "r" value should be clamped.

```cryptol
Poly1305 key msg = result where
    [ru, su] = split key
    r : [136] // internal arithmetic on (128+8)-bit numbers
    r = littleendian ((Poly1305_clamp (split ru)) # [0x00])
    s = littleendian ((split su) # [0x00])
```

Next, divide the message into 16-byte blocks. The last block might be shorter:

 * Read each block as a little-endian number.
 * Add one bit beyond the number of octets.  For a 16-byte block this
   is equivalent to adding 2^128 to the number.  For the shorter
   block it can be 2^120, 2^112, or any power of two that is evenly
   divisible by 8, all the way down to 2^8.

```cryptol
    // pad all the blocks uniformly (we'll handle the final block later)
    paddedBlocks = [ 0x01 # (littleendian block)
                   | block <- groupBy`{16}(msg # (zero:[inf][8])) ]
```
 * If the block is not 17 bytes long (the last block), then left-pad it with
   zeros.  This is meaningless if you're treating them as numbers.

```cryptol
    lastBlock : [136]
    lastBlock = zero # 0x01 # (littleendian (drop`{16*floorBlocks} msg))
```

 *  Add the current block to the accumulator.
 *  Multiply by "r"
 *  Set the accumulator to the result modulo p.  To summarize: 
    ``accum[i+1] = ((accum[i]+block)*r) % p``.

```cryptol
    accum:[_][136]
    accum = [zero:[136]] # [ computeElt a b r P | a <- accum | b <- paddedBlocks ]
    //       ^ the accumulator starts at zero
```

 * If the block division leaves no remainder, the last value of the accumulator is good
   otherwise compute the special-case padded block, and compute the final value of the accumulator

```cryptol
    lastAccum : [136]
    lastAccum = if `rem == 0
                   then accum@`floorBlocks
                   else computeElt (accum@`floorBlocks) lastBlock r P
```

Finally, the value of the secret key "s" is added to the accumulator,
and the 128 least significant bits are serialized in little-endian
order to form the tag.

```cryptol
    result = reverse (groupBy`{8} (drop`{8}(lastAccum + s)))

// Compute ((a + b) * r ) % P being pedantic about bit-widths
computeElt : [136] -> [136] -> [136] -> [136] -> [136]
computeElt a b r p = (drop`{137}bigResult) where
    bigResult : [273]
    aPlusB : [137]
    aPlusB = (0b0#a) + (0b0#b)                        // make room for carry
    timesR : [273]
    timesR = ((zero:[136])#aPlusB) * ((zero:[137])#r) // [a]*[b]=[a+b]
    bigResult = timesR % ((zero:[137])#p)

```

### Poly1305 Example and Test Vector

For our example, we will dispense with generating the one-time key
using AES, and assume that we got the following keying material:

 * Key Material: 85:d6:be:78:57:55:6d:33:7f:44:52:fe:42:d5:06:a8:01:
   03:80:8a:fb:0d:b2:fd:4a:bf:f6:af:41:49:f5:1b

```cryptol
Poly1305TestKey = join (parseHexString 
    ( "85:d6:be:78:57:55:6d:33:7f:44:52:fe:42:d5:06:a8:01:"
    # "03:80:8a:fb:0d:b2:fd:4a:bf:f6:af:41:49:f5:1b."
    ) )
```

 * s as an octet string: 01:03:80:8a:fb:0d:b2:fd:4a:bf:f6:af:41:49:f5:1b
 * s as a 128-bit number: 1bf54941aff6bf4afdb20dfb8a800301

```cryptol
Poly1305Test_s = parseHexString
    "01:03:80:8a:fb:0d:b2:fd:4a:bf:f6:af:41:49:f5:1b."
Poly1305Test_sbits = join (reverse Poly1305Test_s)

property poly1306Sokay = Poly1305Test_sbits == 0x1bf54941aff6bf4afdb20dfb8a800301
```


```cryptol
Poly1305TestMessage = "Cryptographic Forum Research Group"
```

 * r before clamping: 85:d6:be:78:57:55:6d:33:7f:44:52:fe:42:d5:06:a8
 * Clamped r as a number: 806d5400e52447c036d555408bed685.

Since Poly1305 works in 16-byte chunks, the 34-byte message divides
into 3 blocks.  In the following calculation, "Acc" denotes the
accumulator and "Block" the current block:

Here we define a Cryptol function that returns all of the intermediate
values of the accumulator:

```cryptol
// TODO: refactor the Poly function in terms of this AccumBlocks
// challenge: doing so while maintaining the clean literate correspondence with the spec
AccumBlocks : {m, floorBlocks, rem} (fin m, floorBlocks == m/16, rem == m - floorBlocks*16) 
              => [256] -> [m][8] -> ([_][136], [136])

AccumBlocks key msg = (accum, lastAccum) where
    [ru, su] = split key
    r : [136] // internal arithmetic on (128+8)-bit numbers
    r = littleendian ((Poly1305_clamp (split ru)) # [0x00])
    s = littleendian ((split su) # [0x00])
    // pad all the blocks uniformly (we'll handle the final block later)
    paddedBlocks = [ 0x01 # (littleendian block)
                   | block <- groupBy`{16}(msg # (zero:[inf][8])) ]
    lastBlock : [136]
    lastBlock = zero # 0x01 # (littleendian (drop`{16*floorBlocks} msg))
    accum:[_][136]
    accum = [zero:[136]] # [ computeElt a b r P | a <- accum | b <- paddedBlocks ]
    //       ^ the accumulator starts at zero
    lastAccum : [136]
    lastAccum = if `rem == 0
                   then accum@`floorBlocks
                   else computeElt (accum@`floorBlocks) lastBlock r P

```

```example

## Generating the Poly1305 key using ChaCha20

As said in the "Poly 1305 Algorithm" section, it is acceptable to generate
the one-time Poly1305 pseudo-randomly.  This section proposes such a method.

To generate such a key pair (r,s), we will use the ChaCha20 block
function described in Section 2.3.  This assumes that we have a 256-
bit session key for the MAC function, such as SK_ai and SK_ar in
IKEv2 ([RFC5996]), the integrity key in ESP and AH, or the
client_write_MAC_key and server_write_MAC_key in TLS.  Any document
that specifies the use of Poly1305 as a MAC algorithm for some
protocol must specify that 256 bits are allocated for the integrity
key.  Note that in the AEAD construction defined in Section 2.8, the
same key is used for encryption and key generation, so the use of
SK_a* or *_write_MAC_key is only for stand-alone Poly1305.

The method is to call the block function with the following
parameters:
   
 * The 256-bit session integrity key is used as the ChaCha20 key.
 * The block counter is set to zero.
 * The protocol will specify a 96-bit or 64-bit nonce.  This MUST be
   unique per invocation with the same key, so it MUST NOT be
   randomly generated.  A counter is a good way to implement this,
   but other methods, such as an LFSR are also acceptable.  ChaCha20
   as specified here requires a 96-bit nonce.  So if the provided
   nonce is only 64-bit, then the first 32 bits of the nonce will be
   set to a constant number.  This will usually be zero, but for
   protocols with multiple senders it may be different for each
   sender, but should be the same for all invocations of the function
   with the same key by a particular sender.

After running the block function, we have a 512-bit state.  We take
the first 256 bits or the serialized state, and use those as the one-
time Poly1305 key: The first 128 bits are clamped, and form "r",
while the next 128 bits become "s".  The other 256 bits are
discarded.

Note that while many protocols have provisions for a nonce for
encryption algorithms (often called Initialization Vectors, or IVs),
they usually don't have such a provision for the MAC function.  In
that case the per-invocation nonce will have to come from somewhere
else, such as a message counter.
   
### Poly1305 Key Generation Test Vector

For this example, we'll set:

```cryptol
PolyKeyTest = join (parseHexString (
    "80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 8a 8b 8c 8d 8e 8f " #
    "90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 9a 9b 9c 9d 9e 9f "
    ))

PolyNonceTest : [96]
PolyNonceTest = join (
    parseHexString ("00 00 00 00 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 "))
```

The ChaCha state set up with key, nonce, and block counter zero:

## A Pseudo-Random Function for ChaCha/Poly-1305 based Crypto Suites

Some protocols such as IKEv2([RFC5996]) require a Pseudo-Random
Function (PRF), mostly for key derivation.  In the IKEv2 definition,
a PRF is a function that accepts a variable-length key and a
variable-length input, and returns a fixed-length output.  This
section does not specify such a function.

Poly-1305 is an obvious choice, because MAC functions are often used
as PRFs.  However, Poly-1305 prohibits using the same key twice,
whereas the PRF in IKEv2 is used multiple times with the same key.
Adding a nonce or a counter to Poly-1305 can solve this issue, much
as we do when using this function as a MAC, but that would require
changing the interface for the PRF function.

Chacha20 could be used as a key-derivation function, by generating an
arbitrarily long keystream.  However, that is not what protocols such
as IKEv2 require.

For this reason, this document does not specify a PRF, and recommends
that crypto suites use some other PRF such as PRF_HMAC_SHA2_256
(section 2.1.2 of [RFC4868])

## AEAD Construction

AEAD_CHACHA20-POLY1305 is an authenticated encryption with additional
data algorithm.  The inputs to AEAD_CHACHA20-POLY1305 are:

 *  A 256-bit key
 *  A 96-bit nonce - different for each invocation with the same key.
 *  An arbitrary length plaintext (fewer than 2^64 bytes)
 *  Arbitrary length additional data (AAD) (fewer than 2^64 bytes)

Some protocols may have unique per-invocation inputs that are not 96-
bit in length.  For example, IPsec may specify a 64-bit nonce.  In
such a case, it is up to the protocol document to define how to
transform the protocol nonce into a 96-bit nonce, for example by
concatenating a constant value.

The ChaCha20 and Poly1305 primitives are combined into an AEAD that
takes a 256-bit key and 96-bit nonce as follows:

 *  First, a Poly1305 one-time key is generated from the 256-bit key
    and nonce using the procedure described in "Generating the Poly1305 key using ChaCha20".

 *  Next, the ChaCha20 encryption function is called to encrypt the
    plaintext, using the input key and nonce, and with the initial
    counter set to 1.

 *  Finally, the Poly1305 function is called with the Poly1305 key
    calculated above, and a message constructed as a concatenation of
    the following:
    *  The AAD
    *  padding1 - the padding is up to 15 zero bytes, and it brings
       the total length so far to an integral multiple of 16.  If the
       length of the AAD was already an integral multiple of 16 bytes,
       this field is zero-length.
    *  The ciphertext
    *  padding2 - the padding is up to 15 zero bytes, and it brings
       the total length so far to an integral multiple of 16.  If the
       length of the ciphertext was already an integral multiple of 16
       bytes, this field is zero-length.
    *  The length of the additional data in octets (as a 64-bit
       little-endian integer).
    *  The length of the ciphertext in octets (as a 64-bit little-
       endian integer).

The output from the AEAD is twofold:

 *  A ciphertext of the same length as the plaintext.
 *  A 128-bit tag, which is the output of the Poly1305 function.

Decryption is pretty much the same thing.

A few notes about this design:

 1.  The amount of encrypted data possible in a single invocation is
     2^32-1 blocks of 64 bytes each, because of the size of the block
     counter field in the ChaCha20 block function.  This gives a total
     of 247,877,906,880 bytes, or nearly 256 GB.  This should be
     enough for traffic protocols such as IPsec and TLS, but may be
     too small for file and/or disk encryption.  For such uses, we can
     return to the original design, reduce the nonce to 64 bits, and
     use the integer at position 13 as the top 32 bits of a 64-bit
     block counter, increasing the total message size to over a
     million petabytes (1,180,591,620,717,411,303,360 bytes to be
     exact).

 1.  Despite the previous item, the ciphertext length field in the
     construction of the buffer on which Poly1305 runs limits the
     ciphertext (and hence, the plaintext) size to 2^64 bytes, or
     sixteen thousand petabytes (18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes to
     be exact).

### Example and Test Vector for AEAD_CHACHA20-POLY1305

For a test vector, we will use the following inputs to the
AEAD_CHACHA20-POLY1305 function:

# Implementation Advice

Each block of ChaCha20 involves 16 move operations and one increment
operation for loading the state, 80 each of XOR, addition and Roll
operations for the rounds, 16 more add operations and 16 XOR
operations for protecting the plaintext.  Section 2.3 describes the
ChaCha block function as "adding the original input words".  This
implies that before starting the rounds on the ChaCha state, we copy
it aside, only to add it in later.  This is correct, but we can save
a few operations if we instead copy the state and do the work on the
copy.  This way, for the next block you don't need to recreate the
state, but only to increment the block counter.  This saves
approximately 5.5% of the cycles.

It is not recommended to use a generic big number library such as the
one in OpenSSL for the arithmetic operations in Poly1305.  Such
libraries use dynamic allocation to be able to handle any-sized
integer, but that flexibility comes at the expense of performance as
well as side-channel security.  More efficient implementations that
run in constant time are available, one of them in DJB's own library,
NaCl ([NaCl]).  A constant-time but not optimal approach would be to
naively implement the arithmetic operations for a 288-bit integers,
because even a naive implementation will not exceed 2^288 in the
multiplication of (acc+block) and r.  An efficient constant-time
implementation can be found in the public domain library poly1305-
donna ([poly1305_donna]).


# Security Considerations

The ChaCha20 cipher is designed to provide 256-bit security.

The Poly1305 authenticator is designed to ensure that forged messages
are rejected with a probability of 1-(n/(2^102)) for a 16n-byte
message, even after sending 2^64 legitimate messages, so it is SUF-
CMA in the terminology of [AE].

Proving the security of either of these is beyond the scope of this
document.  Such proofs are available in the referenced academic
papers.

The most important security consideration in implementing this draft
is the uniqueness of the nonce used in ChaCha20.  Counters and LFSRs
are both acceptable ways of generating unique nonces, as is
encrypting a counter using a 64-bit cipher such as DES.  Note that it
is not acceptable to use a truncation of a counter encrypted with a
128-bit or 256-bit cipher, because such a truncation may repeat after
a short time.

The Poly1305 key MUST be unpredictable to an attacker.  Randomly
generating the key would fulfill this requirement, except that
Poly1305 is often used in communications protocols, so the receiver
should know the key.  Pseudo-random number generation such as by
encrypting a counter is acceptable.  Using ChaCha with a secret key
and a nonce is also acceptable.

The algorithms presented here were designed to be easy to implement
in constant time to avoid side-channel vulnerabilities.  The
operations used in ChaCha20 are all additions, XORs, and fixed
rotations.  All of these can and should be implemented in constant
time.  Access to offsets into the ChaCha state and the number of
operations do not depend on any property of the key, eliminating the
chance of information about the key leaking through the timing of
cache misses.

For Poly1305, the operations are addition, multiplication and
modulus, all on >128-bit numbers.  This can be done in constant time,
but a naive implementation (such as using some generic big number
library) will not be constant time.  For example, if the
multiplication is performed as a separate operation from the modulus,
the result will some times be under 2^256 and some times be above
2^256.  Implementers should be careful about timing side-channels for
Poly1305 by using the appropriate implementation of these operations.
