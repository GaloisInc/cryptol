-- | The monad for Cryptol evaluation.
--   A computation is either "ready", which means it represents
--   only trivial computation, or is an "eval" action which must
--   be computed to get the answer, or it is a "thunk", which
--   represents a delayed, shared computation.
data Eval a
   = Ready !a
   | Eval !(CallStack -> IO a)
   | Thunk !(TVar (ThunkState a))

-- | This datastructure tracks the lifecycle of a thunk.
--
--   Thunks are used for basically three use cases.  First,
--   we use thunks to preserve sharing.  Basically every
--   cryptol expression that is bound to a name, and is not
--   already obviously a value (and in a few other places as
--   well) will get turned into a thunk in order to avoid
--   recomputation.  These thunks will start in the `Unforced`
--   state, and have a backup computation that just raises
--   the `LoopError` exception.
--
--   Secondly, thunks are used to cut cycles when evaluating
--   recursive definition groups.  Every named clause in a
--   recursive definition is thunked so that the value can appear
--   in its definition.  Such thunks start in the `Void` state,
--   as they must exist before we have a definition to assign them.
--   Forcing a thunk in the `Void` state is a programmer error (panic).
--   Once the body of a definition is ready, we replace the
--   thunk with the relevant computation, going to the `Unforced` state.
--
--   In the third case, we are using thunks to provide an optimistic
--   shortcut for evaluation.  In these cases we first try to run a
--   computation that is stricter than the semantics actually allows.
--   If it succeeds, all is well an we continue.  However, if it tight
--   loops, we fall back on a lazier (and generally more expensive)
--   version, which is the "backup" computation referred to above.
data ThunkState a
  = Void !String
       -- ^ This thunk has not yet been initialized
  | Unforced !(IO a) !(Maybe (IO a)) !String !CallStack
       -- ^ This thunk has not yet been forced.  We keep track of the "main"
       --   computation to run and an optional "backup" computation to run if we
       --   detect a tight loop when evaluating the first one.
       --   The final two arguments are used to throw a loop exception
       --   if the backup computation also causes a tight loop.
  | UnderEvaluation !ThreadId !(Maybe (IO a)) !String !CallStack
       -- ^ This thunk is currently being evaluated by the thread with the given
       --   thread ID.  We track an optional "backup" computation to run if we detect
       --   a tight loop evaluating this thunk.  If the thunk is being evaluated
       --   by some other thread, the current thread will await its completion.
