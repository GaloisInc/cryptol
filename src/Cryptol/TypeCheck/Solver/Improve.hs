--
--  A o B = R  when `uvar` is only present in A
--  A o B = R  when `uvar` is only present in B
--
-- In the first case, as we only consider addition and subtraction, the
-- rewriting will continue on the left, after moving the `B` side to the RHS of
-- the equation.  In the second case, if the operation is addition, the `A` side
-- will be moved to the RHS, with rewriting continuing in `B`. However, in the
-- case of subtraction, the `B` side is moved to the RHS, and rewriting
-- continues on the RHS instead.
--
-- In both cases, if the operation is addition, rewriting will only continue if
-- the operand being moved to the RHS is known to be finite. If this check was
-- not done, we would end up violating the well-definedness condition for
-- subtraction (for a, b: well defined (a - b) iff fin b).
