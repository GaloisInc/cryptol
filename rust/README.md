This directory contains Rust code that is useful for defining high-level
APIs on top of Cryptol's foreign function interface (FFI). Currently, there is
only one subdirectory:

* `cry-ffi`: A Rust crate that streamlines the process of making Rust functions
  that adhere to Cryptol's `abstract` FFI calling convention.
